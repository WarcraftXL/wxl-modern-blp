// The Client's texture loader decodes palettized (1) and DXT (2) BLP, but NOT the uncompressed-BGRA
// encoding (3) introduced after it. A modern source ships smooth textures (skies) as encoding 3, which the
// Client cannot read -> they render white. This re-encodes an encoding-3 image to DXT5 (encoding 2), which
// the Client reads, keeping the full mip chain. Pure bytes -> bytes.
